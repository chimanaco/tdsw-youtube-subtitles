# TDSW Youtube Subtitles

These are subtitles files for TDSW Youtube Channel. We are working on English subtitles, but our English could be strange because English is not our native language. Feel free to improve the subtitles if you find our tutorials are useful for you and the community!

You can edit sbv files with a text editor or a subtitle editor. We use [Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) for editing.
